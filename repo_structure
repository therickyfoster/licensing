## Key Files to Create:

### 1. **README.md** - Clear Philosophy
```markdown
# Planetary Restoration Archive Licensing Framework

## Our Philosophy: Impact First, Sustainability Always

We believe planetary restoration technology should be:
- **Free to use** for those doing the work
- **Sustainable** for those building the tools
- **Transparent** in governance and revenue

## How It Works

### 🌍 Core Technology: Forever Free (AGPL v3)
All core restoration tools, frameworks, and methodologies are licensed under AGPL v3, ensuring they remain free and improvements flow back to the community.

### 💚 Sustainability Services: Optional Paid Support
We offer optional services that make deployment easier:
- Managed hosting and monitoring
- Impact verification and reporting
- Training and certification
- Enterprise support

### 🤝 Revenue Sharing: Community Driven
Revenue from services is transparently shared:
- 40% - Core development
- 20% - Contributor rewards
- 20% - Impact grants
- 10% - Community treasury
- 10% - Emergency fund

## Quick Start

1. **Using the technology?** → It's free under AGPL v3
2. **Want managed services?** → See our [service offerings](REVENUE-MODEL.md)
3. **Want to contribute?** → Read the [contributor agreement](licenses/contributor-agreement.md)
4. **Building a business?** → Check our [dual license guide](examples/dual-license-setup.md)
```

### 2. **CORE-LICENSE.md** - Simple AGPL v3
```markdown

## Why AGPL?
We chose AGPL to ensure that improvements to planetary restoration technology 
return to the commons, while still allowing sustainable business models through 
services and support.

contract PRARevenueSharing {
    address public coreDevelopment;  // 40%
    address public contributorPool;   // 20%
    address public impactGrants;      // 20%
    address public communityTreasury; // 10%
    address public emergencyFund;     // 10%
    
    event RevenueDistributed(uint256 amount);
    
    function distributeRevenue() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "No revenue to distribute");
        
        uint256 amount = msg.value;
        
        // Distribute according to model
        payable(coreDevelopment).transfer(amount * 40 / 100);
        payable(contributorPool).transfer(amount * 20 / 100);
        payable(impactGrants).transfer(amount * 20 / 100);
        payable(communityTreasury).transfer(amount * 10 / 100);
        payable(emergencyFund).transfer(amount * 10 / 100);
        
        emit RevenueDistributed(amount);
    }
}
```
