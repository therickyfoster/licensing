## PREAMBLE AND LEGAL FOUNDATION

The Planetary Restoration Archive (PRA) is established as a permanent, decentralized repository of technologies, methodologies, frameworks, and systems designed to restore Earth's biospheres and ensure humanity's multi-generational survival in the face of ecological collapse.

This License addresses critical vulnerabilities in traditional open source licensing while leveraging emerging environmental legal frameworks, including constitutional environmental rights recognized in over 100 countries, Paris Agreement technology transfer obligations under Articles 10.5-10.6, and the United Nations General Assembly declaration of access to clean, healthy, and sustainable environments as a fundamental human right.

**Contractual Formation and Dual Enforceability**

By exercising any rights to the Licensed Work provided herein, including but not limited to use, reproduction, modification, distribution, or deployment, you explicitly accept and agree to be bound by all terms of this License. This acceptance creates both a copyright license and a binding contractual relationship enforceable under contract law, ensuring comprehensive legal protection against circumvention attempts.

**Environmental Legal Integration**

This License operates within the framework of international environmental law, specifically incorporating technology transfer obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Licensed technologies are designated as essential climate adaptation and mitigation technologies subject to enhanced sharing obligations under international environmental treaties.
