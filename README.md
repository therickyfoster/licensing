# Planetary Restoration Archive Licensing Framework

## 🌍 Our Mission: Maximum Impact, Sustainable Development

We believe planetary restoration technology should be **universally accessible** while ensuring the **builders can sustain themselves**. This repository contains our licensing framework that balances open access with economic sustainability.

---

## ✨ Simple Philosophy

### Technology = Free | Support = Sustainable

**Every line of code** for planetary restoration remains free forever under AGPL v3.  
**Every hour of support** that makes deployment easier can generate sustainable income.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Core Technology: Forever Free (AGPL v3)
All restoration tools, frameworks, and methodologies are licensed under [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html):
- ✅ **Free** to use, modify, and distribute
- ✅ **Improvements** must be shared back
- ✅ **Network use** requires source disclosure  
- ✅ **Patent protection** included

### 2. Optional Services: Sustainable Revenue
Organizations can choose paid services for convenience:
- 🔍 **Impact Verification** - Automated reporting for funders ($29-999/mo)
- 🚀 **Managed Deployments** - We handle the technical complexity ($99-2,999/mo)
- 🎓 **Training & Certification** - Build expertise in your team ($299-2,999)
- 🏢 **Enterprise Support** - Dedicated assistance at scale ($10k-100k/yr)

### 3. Transparent Revenue Sharing
Every dollar earned is distributed via smart contract:
```
40% → Core Development (keeps tools free & improving)
20% → Contributor Rewards (pays the community)
20% → Impact Grants (funds new deployments)
10% → Community Treasury (DAO-governed funds)
10% → Emergency Fund (disaster response)
```
